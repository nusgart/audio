	Meta Audio engine is a simple audio engine using OpenAL that takes commands on standard input and outputs to the sound card.
	All vectors are 3d vectors.
Commands:
*load <soundname> <soundfile> -- load a MPCM file - this is a little-endian file with the following structure - int magic = 'MPCM', int format, int frequency, int length, byte[length] data
*playSound <soundname> <position> <velocity> <pitch> <gain> -- play a sound that has been loaded
*quit  -- quit the engine
